An entity can represent a human user as well as a technical or logical item (e.g. a machine, device or a service). To simplify the access control management, specific roles can be assigned to entity groups. \\n The following should be taken into account when defining and implementing access control rules: \\n a) consistency between the access rights and information classification; \\n b) consistency between the access rights and the physical perimeter security needs and requirements; \\c) considering all types of available connections in distributed environments so entities are only provided with access to information and other associated assets, including networks and network services, that they are authorized to use; \\\n d)  considering how elements or factors relevant to dynamic access control can be reflected.",
        "Other_Information": "There are often overarching principles used in the context of access control. Two of the most frequently used principles are: \\n a) need-to-know: an entity is only granted access to the information which that entity requires in order to perform its tasks (different tasks or roles mean different need-to-know information and hence different access profiles); \\n b)  need-to-use: an entity is only assigned access to information technology infrastructure where a clear need is present. \\n Care should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider: \\n a) establishing rules based on the premise of least privilege, “Everything is generally forbidden unless expressly permitted”, rather than the weaker rule, “Everything is generally permitted unless expressly forbidden”; \\n b) changes in information labels (see 5.13) that are initiated automatically by information processing facilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user; \\n c) changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those initiated by an administrator; \\n d) when to define and regularly review the approval. \\n Access control rules should be supported by documented procedures (see 5.16, 5.17, 5.18, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.18) and defined responsibilities (see 5.2, 5.17). \\n There are several ways to implement access control, such as MAC (mandatory access control), DAC (discretionary access control), RBAC (role-based access control) and ABAC (attribute-based access control). \\n Access control rules can also contain dynamic elements (e.g. a function that evaluates past accesses or specific environment values). Access control rules can be implemented in different granularity, ranging from covering whole networks or systems to specific data fields and can also consider properties such as user location or the type of network connection that is used for access. These principles and how granular access control is defined can have a significant cost impact. Stronger rules and more granularity typically lead to higher cost. Business requirements and risk considerations should be used to define which access control rules are applied and which granularity is required."

In such cases, additional technical safeguards can be required on the device. For example, ensuring that downloading files for offline working is disabled and that local storage such as SD card is disabled. As far as possible, the recommendations on this control should be enforced through configuration management (see 8.9) or automated tools. User_responsibility \\n All users should be made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting user endpoint devices, as well as of their responsibilities for implementing such security measures. Users should be advised to: \\n a) log-off active sessions and terminate services when no longer needed; \\n b) protect user endpoint devices from unauthorized use with a physical control (e.g. key lock or special locks) and logical control (e.g. password access) when not in use; not leave devices carrying important, sensitive or critical business information unattended; \\n c) use devices with special care in public places, open offices, meeting places and other unprotected areas (e.g. avoid reading confidential information if people can read from the back, use privacy screen filters); \\n d) physically protect user endpoint devices against theft (e.g. in cars and other forms of transport, hotel rooms, conference centres and meeting places). \\n A specific procedure taking into account legal, statutory, regulatory, contractual (including insurance) and other security requirements of the organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of user endpoint devices. \\n Use_of_personal_devices \\n Where the organization allows the use of personal devices (sometimes known as BYOD), in addition the guidance given in this control, the following should be considered: \\n a) separation of personal and business use of the devices, including using software to support such separation and protect business data on a private device; \\n b) providing access to business information only after users have acknowledged their duties (physical protection, software updating, etc.), waiving ownership of business data, allowing remote wiping of data by the organization in case of theft or loss of the device or when no longer authorized to use the service. In such cases, PII protection legislation should be considered; \\n c) topic-specific policies and procedures to prevent disputes concerning rights to intellectual property developed on privately owned equipment; \\n d) access to privately owned equipment (to verify the security of the machine or during an investigation), which can be prevented by legislation; \\n e) software licensing agreements that are such that organizations can become liable for licensing for client software on user endpoint devices owned privately by personnel or external party users. \\n Wireless_connections \\n The organization should establish procedures for: \\n a) the configuration of wireless connections on devices (e.g. disabling vulnerable protocols); \\n b) using wireless or wired connections with appropriate bandwidth in accordance with relevant topic-specific policies (e.g. because backups or software updates are needed).",

If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body. \\n The following guidance should be considered to address technical vulnerabilities: \\n a) taking appropriate and timely action in response to the identification of potential technical vulnerabilities; defining a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities; \\n b) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, carrying out the action according to the controls related to change management (see 8.32) or by following information security incident response procedures (see 5.26); \\n c) only using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or external to the organization); \\n d) testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated [i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks associated with installing the update (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the update)]; \\n e) addressing systems at high risk first; \\n f) develop remediation (typically software updates or patches); \\n g) test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective; \\n h) provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation; \\n i) if no update is available or the update cannot be installed, considering other controls, such as: \\n 1) applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or other relevant sources; \\n 2) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability; \\n 3) adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network borders (see 8.20 to 8.22); \\n 4) shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from attack through deployment of suitable traffic filters (sometimes called virtual patching); \\n 5) increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks; \\n 6) raising awareness of the vulnerability. \\n For acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information about security updates for their software and provide a facility to install such updates automatically, the organization should decide whether to use the automatic update or not. Other_considerations \\n An audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical vulnerability management. \\n The technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency. \\n An effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management activities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide technical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs. \\n Where the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party cloud service provider, technical vulnerability management of cloud service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service provider. The cloud service provider’s responsibilities for technical vulnerability management should be part of the cloud service agreement and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service provider's actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see 5.23). For some cloud services, there are respective responsibilities for the cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example, the cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management of its own assets used for the cloud services.",
        "Other_Information": "Technical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as such can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 8.32). \\n There is a possibility that an update does not address the problem adequately and has negative side effects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has been applied. \\n If adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of costs or lack of resources) a delay in updating can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other users. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial. \\n Where software patches or updates are produced, the organization can consider providing an automated update process where these updates are installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update process is offered, it can allow the customer or user to choose an option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of the installation of the update. \\n Where the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates can be installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention, the organization determines if it applies the automated process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to retain control over when the update is performed. For example, a software used for a business operation cannot be updated until the operation has completed. \\n A weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does not fully account for defence in depth: two countermeasures that are always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked by strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability scanner can report that both components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care in reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports. \\n Many organizations supply software, systems, products and services not only within the organization but also to interested parties such as customers, partners or other users. These software, systems, products and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect the security of users. \\n Organizations can release remediation and disclose information about vulnerabilities to users (typically through a public advisory) and provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database services. \\n For more information relating to the management of technical vulnerabilities when using cloud computing, see the ISO/IEC 19086 series and ISO/IEC 27017. \\n ISO/IEC 29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability reports and publishing vulnerability advisories.

        "Other_Information": "A guiding principle is to ensure security-relevant code is invoked when necessary and is tamperresistant. Programs installed from compiled binary code also have these properties but only for data held within the application. For interpreted languages, the concept only works when the code is executed on a server that is otherwise inaccessible by the users and processes that use it, and that its data is held in a similarly protected database. For example, the interpreted code can be run on a cloud service where access to the code itself requires administrator privileges. Such administrator access should be protected by security mechanisms such as just-in-time administration principles and strong authentication. If the application owner can access scripts by direct remote access to the server, so in principle can an attacker. Webservers should be configured to prevent directory browsing in such cases. \\n Application code is best designed on the assumption that it is always subject to attack, through error or malicious action. In addition, critical applications can be designed to be tolerant of internal faults. For example, the output from a complex algorithm can be checked to ensure that it lies within safe bounds before the data is used in an application such as a safety or financial critical application. The code that performs the boundary checks is simple and therefore much easier to prove correctness. \\n Some web applications are susceptible to a variety of vulnerabilities that are introduced by poor design and coding, such as database injection and cross-site scripting attacks. In these attacks, requests can be manipulated to abuse the webserver functionality. More information on ICT security evaluation can be found in the ISO/IEC 15408 series."

Information can be compromised through careless disposal or re-use of equipment. \\n In addition to secure disk deletion, full-disk encryption reduces the risk of disclosure of confidential information when equipment is disposed of or redeployed, provided that: \\n a) the encryption process is sufficiently strong and covers the entire disk (including slack space, swap files); \\n b) the cryptographic keys are long enough to resist brute force attacks; \\n c) the cryptographic keys are themselves kept confidential (e.g. never stored on the same disk). \\n For further advice on cryptography, see 8.24. \\n Techniques for securely overwriting storage media differ according to the storage media technology and the classification level of the information on the storage media. Overwriting tools should be reviewed to make sure that they are applicable to the technology of the storage media. \\n See ISO/IEC 27040 for detail on methods for sanitizing storage media."
